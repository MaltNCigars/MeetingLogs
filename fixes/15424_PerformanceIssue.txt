Estimated time to fix:
-8-10 hours to find where the code is slowing down
 by tracing, using cProfile and a graph for function calls.
-1-2 hours to implement the fix.

Test description:
Tested the code with different amount of arguments. Code started slowing down
significantly at 10 to 20 arguments, at 50 arguments it took around 1 minute to finish.
After implementing the fix, the code takes less than 10 seconds to finish.
