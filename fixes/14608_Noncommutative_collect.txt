The collect method is supposed to group terms in an additive
expression based on the order of specified variables contained
therein.

`collect(a*b + a*c, a)` should return `a*(b+c)` if a,b,c are commutative
symbols.

Another sympy user discovered that the collect method ignores
noncommutativity of the terms being collected. Matthew requested
clarification from the developers about the intended output of
`collect` given noncommutative arguments, and proposed a solution:
Since there may be no way to combine the terms of the same order in a
noncommutative situation (consider `collect(x*a*y + p*a*q, a)`, where
a, p, q, x, and y are noncommutative), it may be best to raise an
error upon attempted collection of powers of non-commutative
variables, and make note of this in the documentation.

After clarification on this was given by the lead sympy developer,
another sympy contributor implemented Matthew's proposed solution just
a few hours before Matthew himself did.
