Limit issues:
#15146 -- There is a good chance all three of these are related.
#15323
##new -- See scratch.py -- There is some weirdness with limits and floats.

Dsolve:
#15056 -- Maybe tricky. Has to do with functions of irrelevant variables.

NonCommutative:
#14608 -- Someone else already fixed this issue, but it can still be
       -- improved by allowing 'innocuous' collection of noncommutatives.
##new -- See scratch.py -- Simplification of Matrix exponentials fails.
      -- Simplification of noncommutative exponentials gives wrong result.

Performance:
#15424 -- Some really slow code generation. Worth investigating?
